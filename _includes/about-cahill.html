                    Cahill's Judo Academy was founded in 1948 by Professor John Cahill, in South San Francisco. He was one of the first non-Japanese jujitsu students, studying under Professor Henry S. Okazaki at his dojo in Hawaii.

                <p class="mb-4">
                    Cahill went on to become a highly respected instructor in his own right in Kodenkan Danzan Ryu Jujitsu and Kodokan Judo. That tradition continues today with his son Willy, who moved the dojo to San Bruno, where it is today.

                    Willy Cahill has been an Olympic Judo coach, Paralympic Judo coach, Pan Am Games Judo coach, as well as coaching other regional and national judo teams and judokas.

                    He was promoted to 9th degree black belt in Kodokan Judo, and 10th degree in Kodenkan Jujitsu, making him one of the highest-ranking martial artists in the country.

                <p class="mb-4">
                    Cahill's Judo Academy has produced several Olympians and nearly 1,000 national and international champions.
