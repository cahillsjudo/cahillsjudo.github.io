                    Kodokan Judo was developed by Jigoro Kano in 1882. Professor Kano was a student of many of the old masters of Kodenkan Jujitsu. He realized that these old arts were disappearing, so he set out to revive and organize a systematic course of instruction in these arts.

                    Kano developed judo primarily as a sport, leaving out some of the more dangerous aspects of jujitsu, like kicking and punching. Judo consists of throwing, grappling, choking, and joint locking techniques derived from jujitsu, although it can be used for self-defense.

                    Judo became an Olympic sport in 1964. Tournaments for both junior and senior athletes are held throughout the Bay Area, as well as national and international competitions.
